# Your-Landing-Page
Minimal Portfolio Page Built with React

## Why?
One fine day i was going through GitHub and found an awesome concept on [Dinesh Pandiyan's Profile](https://github.com/flexdinesh/dev-landing-page) and saw that people really liked it and so did i. I really liked the minimalist approach and hence thought that i should take it a step forward. 

Actually the original repo has some static files in which you need to manually go and edit the source code in order to get your landing page up and running. So i have bootstrapped the same content with create-react-app, i.e **REACTJS**. Now you only need to change one config file, run couple of commands and that's it. 

## What features does it possess ?

Well you never know whats coming in future, but as of now it supports :

1. Material Background with Dark and Light Mode toggle with a button click
2.  Each Dark as well as Light Mode supports 7 color combos by default. (Total -14)
3. Background Changes as and when you click anywhere on page.
4. Gradient Background Support with Free Flow Animation 
5. Image background
6. 'n' number of hyperlinked social profile support
7. Deploy the project on you GitHub account with couple of commands.
